    <h1>Shakespeareâ€™s Sonnet 43</h1>
    <span class="intro">This is a Sonnet written by Shakespeare</span>
    <p>
    When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,<br>
    <span class="manythings">For all the day they view things unrespected;</span><br>
    <span id="onething">But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,</span><br>
    And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.<br>
    Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,<br>
    How would thy shadow's form form happy show<br>
    To the clear day with thy much clearer light,<br>
    When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!<br>
    How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made<br>
    By looking on thee in the living day,<br>
    When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade<br>
    <span class="box">Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!</span><br>
    <p>All days are nights to see till I see thee,</p><br>
    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
